        "-> The loss value helps in determining whether the model is good or not by providing a quantitative measure of the difference between the model's predictions and the actual true values. A lower loss value indicates better model performance.\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "-> Continuous variables are numerical variables that can take any value within a range, such as height or weight. Categorical variables are variables that take on distinct categories or labels, such as color or gender.\n",

        "-> sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the scikit-learn library that provides various functions for data preprocessing, including scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        "-> A test set is a portion of the dataset that is not used during training and is instead used to evaluate the trained model's performance.\n",
        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",

        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "-> Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "-> You can find correlation between variables in Python using the corr() function from pandas or the numpy.corrcoef() function from NumPy.\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "-> Causation refers to the relationship between two variables where one variable (the cause) directly affects the other variable (the effect).\n",
        "     explain it -\n",
        "Correlation does not imply causation. For example, there may be a correlation between the number of ice cream sales and the number of people wearing shorts, but this does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to wear shorts or vice versa. Instead, both variables may be influenced by a third variable, such as temperature.\n",
        "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "-> An optimizer is an algorithm used to minimize or maximize a function, typically used in Machine Learning to optimize the model's parameters.\n",
